SVMs are one of the powerful machine learning algorithms for classification, regression and outlier detection purposes. An SVM classifier builds a model that assigns new data points to one of the given categories. Thus, it can be viewed as a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier.\n",

The only possibility is to draw hyperplanes for linear classifier. In 1992, Bernhard E. Boser, Isabelle M Guyon and Vladimir N Vapnik suggested a way to create non-linear classifiers by applying the kernel trick to maximum-margin hyperplanes. The current standard was proposed by Corinna Cortes and Vapnik in 1993 and published in 1995.\n",

A kernel transforms a low-dimensional input data space into a higher dimensional space. So, it converts non-linear separable problems to linear separable problems by adding more dimensions to it. Thus, the kernel trick helps us to build a more accurate classifier. Hence, it is useful in non-linear separation problems."
