        "**Naive Bayes (NB**) is ‘naive’ because it makes the assumption that features of a measurement are independent of each other. This is naive because it is (almost) never true. Here is why NB works anyway.\n",

        "* A naive Bayes classifier is an algorithm that uses Bayes' theorem to classify objects. Naive Bayes classifiers assume strong, or naive, independence between attributes of data points. Popular uses of naive Bayes classifiers include spam filters, text analysis and medical diagnosis. These classifiers are widely used for machine learning because they are simple to implement.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Naive Bayes is also known as simple Bayes or independence Bayes.\n",
        "\n",
        "* A naive Bayes classifier uses probability theory to classify data. Naive Bayes classifier algorithms make use of Bayes' theorem. The key insight of Bayes' theorem is that the probability of an event can be adjusted as new data is introduced.\n",
        "\n",
        "* A naive Bayes classifier is not a single algorithm, but a family of machine learning algorithms that make uses of statistical independence. These algorithms are relatively easy to write and run more efficiently than more complex Bayes algorithms.\n",

        "* The most popular application is spam filters. A spam filter looks at email messages for certain key words and puts them in a spam folder if they match.\n",
        "\n",

        "* What makes a naive Bayes classifier naive is its assumption that all attributes of a data point under consideration are independent of each other. A classifier sorting fruits into apples and oranges would know that apples are red, round and are a certain size, but would not assume all these things at once. Oranges are round too, after all.\n",
        "\n",
        "* One of the major advantages that Naive Bayes has over other classification algorithms is its ability to handle an extremely large number of features. In our case, each word is treated as a feature and there are thousands of different words. Also, it performs well even with the presence of irrelevant features and is relatively unaffected by them.\n",
